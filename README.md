# Gabin Dushime
Hi, I am from the Republic Democratic of the Congo, yeah that's a long name but in short it's Congo and that's in Africa. Anyway, I like to play music, draw, and sing. Also I can speak four languages which are  swahili, french, english, and kinyarwanda. I hope that one day I own a hosting tv show in four languages and Gabin's tower are all over the place selling different countries cultures stuff. The last thing about me is I like to talk about God and Jesus, I think today's society need to hear it more than ever. Thank you for taking your time to read this.
